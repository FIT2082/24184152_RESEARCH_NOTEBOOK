## Week 4

This week we naturally focused on completing the project specification. We were lucky enough to have two drafts marked (one on Monday 
and one on Wednesday), putting us in a good position for submission. 

The timeline from the project specification will now guide the remainder of project activity for the semester, as we try to hit each aim on
a weekly basis. Next week the priority will be to have Microscopium up and running on our personal machines using the full BBBC021 dataset.
This will then allow us to swap out PCA with t-SNE and UMAP with minimal difficulty, and proceed to the task of assessing the different
algorithms and improving Microscopium's UI and UX. 

Below is a replication of the tentative timeline for the remainder of the semester.
